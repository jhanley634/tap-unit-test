TAP-unit-test
=============
Simple unit tests in Common Lisp.

Chris Riesbeck offers an excellent :lisp-unit package at
http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/programs/lisp-unit.lisp
under a BSD-style license.  It is quite simple to use.

The tap-unit-test package reformats the reporting slightly
for TAP output:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol
and makes the code available via GitHub.com and QuickLisp.org.
